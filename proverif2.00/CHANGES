This file summarizes the most important changes between versions
of ProVerif.

Version 2.00

- New keywords in the typed pi calculus front-end:
  do, foreach, implementation, public_vars, secret
  These keywords cannot be used as identifiers.
- Identifiers of processes (in declarations "let P(...) = ")
  must be distinct from other identifiers.
- Allow the conjunction of several events or facts before the
  arrow ==> in queries.
- Interactive simulator:
  - Display events and public terms in order of addition.
  - Show the recipe used to compute a term in the list of public terms,
    when terms are added to public terms.
  - Allow zooming in the graphical trace display.
  - Show fresh names created by the adversary and public terms
    computed by the adversary in the graphical trace display.
  - When the user needs to enter a recipe, display the list of terms,
    so that he has enough information.
  - Button "Forward" to redo a step undone by the "Backward" button.
- Compatibility with CryptoVerif
  - Allow
      a <-R T; P          as a synonym of new a: T; P
      x[:T] <- M; P       as a synonym of let x[:T] = M in P
      foreach i <= N do P as a synonym of ! i <= N P and of ! P
  - Allow and ignore CryptoVerif implementation annotations
  - Allow disequations "equation forall x1:T1, ..., xn:Tn; M1 <> M2."
    and just check that they are valid.
  - Support for event, get, insert in terms (by expansion into processes)
  - New queries:
      query secret x.
      query secret x [real_or_random].
    to test the secrecy of a bound variable or name x.
  - Allow public variables in correspondence and secrecy queries, e.g.:
      query event(e1) ==> event(e2) public_vars x1,...,xn.
      query secret x public_vars x1,...,xn.
- Fixed bug that could cause the addition of a spurious edge,
  when a replication is executed just after a box in the graphical
  display of traces.
- Fixed bug: trace reconstruction failed abnormally in the absence
  of free names.
- Display an error message instead of looping when there is a recursive
  macro in the pi calculus front-end without types.

Version 1.98pl1

- Several bug fixes and minor improvements in the simulator:
  - Added reduction of "event", which was missing.
  - Added column "Events" to show the events that have been executed.
  (Use a menu option to show it.)
  - The column "Tables" is not shown by default, but can be shown
  using a menu option.
  - The elements of the same table are grouped together.
  - The user can add an element to public, by providing the term that
  allows to compute it.
  - Fixed bugs in which the state of the simulator was not correctly
  reinitialized.

Version 1.98

- Simulator to run ProVerif scripts interactively
  (proverif_interact).

Version 1.97pl3

- Modified the code so that it is compatible with OCaml 4.06

Version 1.97pl2

- Fixed bug that could cause an internal error in trace reconstruction,
  when a message was received of a type different from the one expected
  by the input.
- Fixed bug that happened when "sync" was under a process macro.
  It could lead to unbound variables, causing an internal error.

Version 1.97pl1

- Allow assuming that some blocking predicates are false in
  order to execute the else branch of let...suchthat in trace
  reconstruction. (These assumptions are displayed to the user.)
- Improved the function that verifies that a trace falsifies an
  injective query.
- Fixed bug: inequalities were forgotten in the proof of queries with
  non-blocking predicates after ==>.
- Fixed bug in the treatment of queries with symbols involved in the
  equational theory present above variables before ==>. These queries are
  now forbidden.

Version 1.97

- In the display of traces, showed the recipe used by the adversary
compute the terms he sends; minor revision of messages.
- In the graphical display of traces, 
  * explained why the trace is an attack.
  * introduced abbreviations when the label on an edge is too long.
  * added syntactic colors to the keywords and the name of the processes.
  * added line numbers referring to the process.
- Syntactic coloring in the long trace display.
- Fixed display of attacks against observational equivalence that
come from pattern-matchings in inputs.
- Fixed bug that could lead to an infinite loop in
the unification that precedes trace reconstruction.
- Fixed bug that could lead to an internal error
due to bad types in pattern matching.
- Fixed a bug when the goal is a communication on a private channel 
  (trivial attacks were not found).

Version 1.96

- Graphical display of attacks
- Simplification of "if M then P else Q" when M is a constant
true or false. (Useful in particular because the expansion
of terms into processes may create such processes.)
- Fixed bug that could lead to an internal error in the
reconstruction of the derivation for queries "weaksecr"
when ProVerif was compiled with the bytecode compiler.

Version 1.95

- Allow the user to set the environment of events used for proving
  injective correspondences (useful to speed up the proof in some
  examples).
- Allow the user to set the ordering of function symbols, used
  to prove termination of convergent equational theories.
- Fixed bug in the lexicographic path ordering used
  to prove termination of convergent equational theories.
- Fixed bug that could lead to a stack overflow with very large sets
  of clauses (>150000 clauses).
- Fixed bug that lead to saying that queries event(e(M)) ==> event(e(M))
  (with the same event before and after the arrow) were false, while
  in fact they are true.
- Fixed bug that could lead to incorrect occurrence numbers in
  some warning messages.
- Some documentation improvements (in particular, some syntax traps
  are mentioned in Section 6.3.5 of the manual)

Version 1.94pl1

- Fixed bug that could cause a false attack to be erroneously considered
  as a real attack when maxDepth is set.
- Fixed bug that could lead to an internal error in trace reconstruction
  when a Horn clause derivation could not be reconstructed.
- Fixed bug that could cause an internal error, in the presence of events
  when trying to simplify the process in order to prove an equivalence.
  (Events should be ignored but not cause an error in this case.)
- Fixed parsing bug which prevented function declared by "letfun"
  and predicates without arguments to be used without parentheses.
- Fixed bug: bound names "new x" were not recognized in "not" and
  "nounif" declarations after the process simplification made in order
  to prove equivalences.
- Fixed bug that could lead to an incorrect type error in the typing
  of the term "let pat = M in M1 else M2".

Version 1.94

- Added barrier synchronization (sync) and allow swapping of data at barriers
  in order to prove equivalences. See https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01306440

Version 1.93

- Allow "diff" as a synonym for "choice".

Version 1.92

- Added a setting that allows choosing how terms "if ... then ... else ..."
are expanded.

Version 1.91

- Allow "or fail" in arguments of letfun. When "or fail" is present
for a certain argument, and this argument fails, it is still passed
to the letfun body (as in version 1.90). When "or fail" is absent
and the argument fails, the function defined by letfun also fails.
- Allow "or fail" in arguments of process definitions.
When "or fail" is present for a certain argument, and this argument
fails, it is still passed to the process. When "or fail" is absent
and the argument fails, the process stops (as in version 1.90).
- Fixed internal error when using the construct new a[x,y...]:t
inside letfun
- Fixed internal error in process simplification, when a process
macro that defines a fresh name is expanded several times.

Version 1.90

- Reimplemented the merging of two processes into one biprocess
(with V. Cheval)
- Allowing to specify which arguments the internal reprsentation of
a name should have, using the construct new a[x,y,...]:t
- Allow to declare several equations in a single declaration, possibly
with options [convergent] or [linear]. This extension allows one
to bypass the termination test for equations corresponding to a
convergent rewrite system: ProVerif continues with a warning when
the termination test fails for equations marked [convergent].
- Modified the semantics of boolean operators && and ||: when the result
is known from the first argument, the second argument is supposed not
to be evaluated, so the conjunction or disjunction succeeds in this case
even if the second argument fails.
- Fixed serious bug that could yield incorrect result with
"set ignoreTypes = false".
- Fixed bug in display of an error message in the verification of
the implementability of predicates
- Fixed bug with "set movenew = true" and queries "new a[x = ...]":
when x was defined above "new a" and also under "new a" and movenew
lead to moving "new a" under the second definition of x, the wrong
occurrence of x was used in the query.

Version 1.89

- Changed the weight of the goal in the selection function to 3000, to give
the possibility to have a nounif declaration (with weight less than 3000)
such that ProVerif selects facts that match that nounif declaration
rather than selecting the goal.
- Fixed bug in Spass output.
- Allow "table(t(...))" in query, not, and nounif.
- Improved unification modulo to speed it up and avoid a
stack overflow.

Version 1.88pl1

- Changed priorities in the parser, so that (! P1 | ! P2) is
interpreted as ((! P1) | (! P2)) and not as (! (P1 | ! P2)).
- Fixed bug that could lead to an internal error when a query, a not, or
a nounif declaration refers to a bound name that is never generated.
ProVerif now displays a proper error message in this case.

Version 1.88

- Remove subsumed clauses and tautologies from attacker clauses
before displaying them.

Version 1.87beta6

- Fixed several bugs that lead to internal errors instead of
displaying a proper error message.
- Elimination of redundant hypotheses now considers blocking predicates
like events.

Summary of changes between version 1.86pl4 and version 1.87beta5:

- Typed and untyped pi calculus front-ends:
  Extended definition of destructors, by Vincent Cheval.
  Now, destructors must be deterministic.
- Typed pi calculus front-end:
   - Extension of the class of observational equivalences that can be proved,
   by encoding more operations into terms. Automatic transformation of
   processes to benefit from this extension, by Vincent Cheval.
   - Query "equivalence P1 P2" to prove the observational equivalence between
   two processes P1 and P2, by Vincent Cheval.
   - Functions marked "typeConverter" are now automatically marked "data" as
   well.
   - Added an "else" branch to the "get" construct
- New keywords:
   - Typed pi calculus front-end: equivalence, fail, or, otherwise
   - Untyped pi calculus front-end: can, fail, otherwise, where
  These keywords can no longer be used as ordinary identifiers.
- Fixed bugs:
   - Fixed bug in attack reconstruction
   - Fixed bug for query noninterf...among: a clause was forgotten
   that allows the adversary to test whether the secret is a tuple.
   - Fixed bug in attack reconstruction with patterns =M where the
   term M contains a destructor with several rewrite rules.
   - Removed decompData/decompDataSelect options for user-defined
   predicates in the pi/typed pi calculus front-ends, for several reasons:
      * These predicates caused bugs
      * For user-defined predicates, it is not very likely that
      decompData/decompDataSelect are useful
      * The same effect can be achieved by using the equivalences
      forall x1:T1, ..., xn:Tn; p(x1) && ... && p(xn) <=> p(f(x1,...,xn))
      for each data constructor f, in the "clauses" section.
   - Improved termination heuristic so that it does not trigger
   uselessly.
   - Fixed bug with references to bound names of the form new a[x_1 = ...]
   where the variable name x_1 ends with underscore followed by a number.
   (This bug could lead to an error message saying x_1 was not bound,
   when in fact it was.)
   - Fixed bug with nested "letfun" with local variables (there was some
   mixing between these variables)
   - Fixed bug: choice was ignored when it occurred only in patterns.
   - Fixed bug: "else" branches could not be omitted in "if" and
   "let...suchthat" terms.
- Improved the proof of equivalences in case "if M then P else Q"
with Q = 0: the case in which M fails and the case in which M succeeds
and is false cannot be distinguished by the adversary.
- The term "let pat = M in M'" has changed meaning: when M or the
pattern-matching fails, its value is fail, instead of stopping the
whole process.
- The argument of events is always evaluated, even when the event itself
is useless (proof of equivalences, of correspondences that do not involve
that event).
- Patterns (x, =M) in which M depends on x are now forbidden for simplicity.
(Use pattern matching followed by a test to encode that.)
- Optimized elimination of redundant hypotheses

Details of the changes in the beta releases:

* Version 1.87beta5

- Cosmetic changes only.

* Version 1.87beta4 (not a public release)

- Reactivated all front-ends
- New destructors in the untyped front-end
- Simplified the test that destructors are deterministic
- Optimized elimination of redundant hypotheses
- When proving equivalences, the arguments of names are now
choice[.,.] instead of pairs.
- Fixed soundness bugs with choice and with noninterf in case of
inputs with pattern-matching
- Fixed bug in the generation of Horn clauses for trace properties
(some branches were cut too quickly)
- Fixed bug: choice was ignored when it occurred only in patterns.
- Fixed bug with references to bound names of the form new a[x_1 = ...]
where the variable name x_1 ends with underscore followed by a number.
(This bug could lead to an error message saying x_1 was not bound,
when in fact it was.)
- Fixed bug in the computation of rewrite rules for new
destructors (it may have generated too many rules)

* Version 1.87beta3 (not a public release; restricted to the typed
front-end)

- Optimized elimination of redundant hypotheses
- In the definition of user-defined predicates, the meaning of clauses
is the following: the fact in the conclusion holds when the hypotheses
hold and all the arguments of the predicates, equalities and
inequalities in the clause do not fail. (This is closer to the
semantics of user-defined predicates with the old destructors.)
- The argument of events is always evaluated, even when the event itself
is useless (proof of equivalences, of correspondences that do not involve
that event).
- Patterns (x, =M) in which M depends on x are now forbidden for simplicity.
(Use pattern matching followed by a test to encode that.)
- Final fix for the bug that could lead to forgetting some rewrite
rules of destructors, when the new destructors of ProVerif 1.87beta
were combined with equational theories. (This bug was quickly patched
in version 1.87beta2.)
- Fixed bug in which a non-deterministic destructor was not detected as such.
- With respect to ProVerif version 1.86, the term "let pat = M in M'" has
changed meaning: when M or the pattern-matching fails, its value is fail,
instead of stopping the whole process.

* Version 1.87beta2 (not a public release; restricted to the typed
front-end)

- Re-allow proofs of trace properties, noninterf, weaksecr,
updated to the new destructors of ProVerif 1.87beta
- Added an "else" branch to the "get" construct
- Improved the proof of equivalences in case "if M then P else Q"
with Q = 0: the case in which M fails and the case in which M succeeds
and is false cannot be distinguished by the adversary.
- Fixed bug in attack reconstruction: f(...fail...) was left as it is
instead of reducing it to fail, when f is a constructor.
- Fixed bug in merging of parallel processes that could lead to
swapping the first and second processes to merge.
- Quick patch for a bug that could lead to forgetting some rewrite
rules of destructors, when the new destructors of ProVerif 1.87beta
were combined with equational theories
- Also fixed problems that occurred in ProVerif 1.86pl4:
   - Fixed bug for query noninterf...among: a clause was forgotten
   that allows the adversary to test whether the secret is a tuple.
   - Fixed bug in attack reconstruction with patterns =M where the
   term M contains a destructor with several rewrite rules.
   - Removed decompData/decompDataSelect options for user-defined
   predicates in the pi/typed pi calculus front-ends, for several reasons:
      * These predicates caused bugs
      * For user-defined predicates, it is not very likely that
      decompData/decompDataSelect are useful
      * The same effect can be achieved by using the equivalences
      forall x1:T1, ..., xn:Tn; p(x1) && ... && p(xn) <=> p(f(x1,...,xn))
      for each data constructor f, in the "clauses" section.
   - Improved termination heuristic so that it does not trigger
   uselessly.

* Version 1.87beta (restricted to the typed front-end and to proofs of
equivalences with choice)

- Extended definition of destructors, by Vincent Cheval.
Now, destructors must be deterministic.
- Extension of the class of observational equivalences that can be proved,
by encoding more operations into terms. Automatic transformation of
processes to benefit from this extension, by Vincent Cheval.
- Query "equivalence P1 P2" to prove the observational equivalence between
two processes P1 and P2, by Vincent Cheval.
- Functions marked "typeConverter" are now automatically marked "data" as
well.
- Fixed bug in attack reconstruction


Version 1.86pl4

- Removed setting "set ignoreTypes = attacker", still accepted as a synonym
of "set ignoreTypes = false" for compatibility.
- Functions marked "data" can no longer be marked "private". (Functions
marked "private, data" were not correctly handled.)
- Equations now must not introduce variables in their right-hand side
that do not occur in the left-hand side. (There was a bug with such
equations.)
- Fixed bug that could cause Internal error: Name ... has bad type/bad arity.
- Fixed bug that could cause an internal error due to an incorrect
expansion of the condition of "get ... suchthat".

Version 1.86pl3

- Fixed bugs in the generation of clauses for proofs of equivalences.

Version 1.86pl2

- documentation for the typed pi calculus front-end, which is now
the recommended input format.
- fixed bug in attack reconstruction with passive adversaries.

omit trailing 0, reuse initial variable name when possible, ...

Version 1.84pl2

- fixed bug in the generation of clauses for observational
equivalence (choice)

Version 1.84pl1

- some improvements in error messages
- fixed display bug for queries with empty conjunctions

- improved the simplification of derivations, in particular in
the presence of private channels.

  in the terms that are allowed to build compromised terms).
- fixed two bugs in trace reconstruction (one in the presence of choice,
  one in the presence of phases).
- fixed some bugs in the protocol models.
- fixed bugs in proveriftotex (use LaTeX macros when special TeX characters
  appear in the ProVerif file to convert; some ProVerif constructs were
  not handled due to an outdated lexer file).
- typed front-end: for CryptoVerif compatibility,
   - added a def/expand macro mechanism
   - added -lib command-line option
   - added tables, in particular useful for tables of keys
   (the same construct will be added to CryptoVerif; one will be able to use
   it instead of find in the initial game)
   - allow empty patterns (), allow "let" without "in", allow "if f(...) then"
   when f returns a result of type bool.

Version 1.81 (not a public release)

- improved proof of injective correspondences when there are
several occurrences in the process of the events that occur after ==>
in the query.
- heuristic "unifyDerivation" now active by default, and iterated
(following File, Vigo, CSF'09).
- when -in <format> is not specified, the input format is now selected
by the extension of the file:
    .pv for the typed pi-calculus front-end
    .pi for the untyped pi-calculus front-end
    .horntype for the typed Horn clauses front-end
In all other cases, the untyped Horn clauses front-end. Case is not
significant in file extensions.

   - type "bool" and constants "true" and "false" now declared by default;
   - "not" allowed as an ordinary function;
   - bound names of the process must be preceded by "new" when they are
     used in queries, for more clarity;

     compatibility with CryptoVerif
   - ! i <= N allowed for compatibility with CryptoVerif.
   - yield allowed as a synonym of 0 for compatibility with CryptoVerif
   - declarations "letfun f(x1:t1, ..., xn:tn) = M"
